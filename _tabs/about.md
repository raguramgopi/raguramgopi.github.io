Hello World!

I’m Raguram Gopi, a Senior Software Engineer at Delivery Hero with over 8 years of experience building 
software applications. I specialize in backend engineering and am deeply passionate about system architecture 
and databases. Throughout my career, I’ve worked extensively on distributed systems, utilizing 
technologies such as Python, Kafka, Kubernetes, gRPC, and SQL, etc.

I started this blog because writing helps me clarify concepts and boosts my confidence in them. 
I’m committed to sharing what I’ve learned and continue learning. It also helps me improve my 
documentation and communication skills.

Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn if you think I can assist you!
