# Is Binary search better than ternary search?

As everyone know Binary is 2 and ternary is 3. So here, Binary search is used to divide the array into half 
recursively and find the efficient element. What if we do the same with ternary search and split the array 
into thrice. The ternary search should be efficient than binary search right? Let's see which is efficient in 
below post.

## Time Complexity of both algorithms

Binary search -> O(n)
